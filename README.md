# freshPypi

Bash script for automatically checking dependencies (requirements.txt) in Python projects. It checks each dependency in requirements.txt and determines if the specified version is the latest version. If the version is not the latest version, the script offers an interactive interaction with the user where he can either enter the desired version or accept the latest version.

## Getting started

```
./freshPypi.sh <requirements.txt>
```
